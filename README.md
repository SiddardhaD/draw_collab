ðŸŽ¨ Flutter Collaborative Drawing App (POC)

A real-time collaborative drawing app built with Flutter.
Users can join the same channel (lobby) and draw together on a shared canvas â€” strokes are instantly synced across devices of different screen sizes.

This is a Proof of Concept (POC) showcasing real-time sync, clean architecture, and UI features in Flutter. ðŸš€

	
ðŸ”® Future Enhancements

This POC uses Firebase Firestore, but at scale we could:

Replace with WebSockets or MQTT for low-latency sync

Add authentication & roles

Use Redis / Kafka for pub-sub in backend

Enable multi-device + web support (collaborative classrooms, whiteboards, design tools)
