A real-time collaborative drawing app built with Flutter.
Users can join the same channel (lobby) and draw together on a shared canvas â€” strokes are instantly synced across devices of different screen sizes.

This is a Proof of Concept (POC) showcasing real-time sync, clean architecture, and UI features in Flutter. ðŸš€
